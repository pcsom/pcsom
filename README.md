## Hello, I'm Pranav!

I'm pursuing my BS/MS degree in Computer Science at Georgia Tech, with a passion for AI/ML theory and systems. I'm interested in Neural Architecture Search and meta-algorithms that improve Machine Learning processes. I'm currently researching LLM- & surrogate-guided Evolutionary Algorithms to optimize computer vision models at the Georgia Tech Research Institute and Automated Algorithm Design team. I've also had the opportunity to build Gen-AI applications and optimize infrastructure at Amazon Web Services. 

I'm always eager to explore new approaches and applications in AI and Machine Learning algorithms. Let's connect!
